# ZYAL Powerful Examples

Thirteen flagship runbooks that show what ZYAL v2.6 makes possible. Each is a complete `<<<ZYAL v1:daemon>>>` block — paste any of them into a trusted Jekko prompt to preview the runtime plan, then explicitly arm to execute.

| [`09-control-plane-preview.zyal.yml`](09-control-plane-preview.zyal.yml) | Preview-only control-plane contract with interop, runtime, trust, taint, and release metadata | `interop`, `runtime`, `capability_negotiation`, `memory_kernel`, `evidence_graph`, `trust`, `taint`, `requirements`, `evaluation`, `release`, `roles`, `channels`, `imports`, `reasoning_privacy`, `unsupported_feature_policy` |
| [`10-jankurai-master-loop.zyal`](10-jankurai-master-loop.zyal) | Advanced host-enforced jankurai repair and porting loop with repair-plan ingestion, incubator routing, rollback, branch/main regression, taint, memory, evidence, and metrics | `jankurai`, `taint`, `fleet.jnoccio`, `incubator`, `experiments`, `memory`, `evidence`, `rollback`, `done`, `observability` |
| [`12-jankurai-min-loop.zyal`](12-jankurai-min-loop.zyal) | Minimal host-enforced jankurai continuous repair loop for ten low-risk workers, verification, checkpoint commit, and push | `jankurai`, `fleet`, `checkpoint`, `observability` |
| [`13-advanced-research-loop.zyal.yml`](13-advanced-research-loop.zyal.yml) | Evidence-first external research loop with parallel cited search and extraction controls; powers the README demo asset | `research`, `permissions`, `evidence`, `budgets` |

## Running an example

1. Copy the YAML block (including sentinels) into the Jekko prompt.
2. The TUI flips to the **jekko-gold** theme, signalling daemon-arm mode.
3. The host renders the **Run Card**: capabilities granted, budgets, fleet/Jnoccio, taint summary, risk score, unsupported features, and preview-only limitations.
4. Type `ZYAL_ARM RUN_FOREVER id=<run-id>` only after reviewing the Run Card.
5. Watch the run stream events; pause/abort/inspect via `jekko daemon ...` CLI.

## Safety reminder

These examples grant real capabilities. Read the `capabilities`, `permissions`, `rollback`, `jankurai`, and `done` blocks before arming. The current runtime parses and previews `arming` policies, but the shipped start path still accepts the simple `ZYAL_ARM RUN_FOREVER id=<run-id>` sentinel; host nonce/hash arming is a preview contract until the start API is extended. The `jankurai` block is host-enforced when enabled.
The new `research` block is parsed and previewed as a host contract for current external evidence gathering; it is summarized in the Run Card and daemon prompt, while the hosted research backend remains optional and receipt-driven.
